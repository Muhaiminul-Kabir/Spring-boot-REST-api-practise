 # Spring Boot REST API Practice

This repository contains a Spring Boot application designed for practicing the creation and management of RESTful APIs. It serves as a practical guide for developers looking to enhance their understanding of Spring Boot and RESTful web services.

## Overview

This project implements a simple REST API with a focus on key Spring Boot concepts, making it an excellent resource for both beginners and experienced developers. 

## Key Features

- **RESTful Design**: Learn to structure your API following REST principles for better usability and scalability.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement essential Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities on various resources.
- **Database Integration**: Utilize Spring Data JPA with an H2 in-memory database for easy setup and testing.
- **Error Handling**: Includes custom exception handling to provide meaningful error messages and improve user experience.
- **API Security**: Introduction to securing your APIs using Spring Security for basic authentication and authorization.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests to validate functionality and ensure code quality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or later
- Maven

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spring-boot-REST-api-practise.git
